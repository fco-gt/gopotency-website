## The Core Philosophy

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Minimalist & Powerful" icon="rocket">
    GoPotency follows a "Zero-Friction" approach. Integrate idempotency in your
    Gin or Standard HTTP APIs with just **3 lines of code**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Absolute Reliability" icon="approve-check">
    Built for high-concurrency environments with atomic locking, ensuring that
    no request is ever processed twice, regardless of network failures.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Direct Integration

Implement the middleware to your router is easy.

```go
// Apply the middleware to your router
router.Use(ginmw.Idempotency(manager))

// Your existing handlers are now automatically protected
router.POST("/payments", handlePayment)
```
